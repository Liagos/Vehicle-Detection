# Vehicle Detection

This repository contains the code for the project "**Vehicle Detection**". The goal of this project is by using image processing techniques to detect the vehicles on a highway road. 

The repository is organised as follows:
- 1Traffic_PyCharm_V2.py` is used to open the camera stream and detect the vehciles.
- `args.py` is used to import the arguments needed for the project.
- `confing.ini` contains configuration of the cameras, folder path, frame rate, folder name, and maximum number of files to be saved in each folder.

Software dependecies: 
can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

Example:
Run "python Traffic_PyCharm_V2.py" and select a camera by typing "***camera_1***" up to "***camera_6***". Hit "q" to exit.
