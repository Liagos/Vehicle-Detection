The repository is organised as follows:
- ***Traffic_PyCharm_V2*** is used to open the camera stream and detect the vehciles.
- ***args.py*** is used to import the arguments needed for the project
- ***confing.ini*** is the configuration file which contains information about the cameras, folder path, frame rate, folder name, and maximum number of files to be saved in each folder

Software dependecies: 
Can be found in the ***requirements.txt*** file.

Example:
Run python Traffic_PyCharm_V2.py and select a camera by typing "***camera_1*** up to ***camera_6***. Hit "q" to exit.
