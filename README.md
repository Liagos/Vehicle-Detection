# Vehicle Detection

This repository contains the code for the project "**Vehicle Detection**". The goal of this project is to detect vehicles on a highway from real-time video frames using image processing techniques.

The repository is organised as follows:
- The `Traffic_PyCharm_V2.py` file opens the camera stream and detects vehciles.
- The `args.py` file parses the arguments needed for the execution.
- The `confing.ini` file contains the camera configuration, frame rate, and maximum number of files to save in each folder.

Software dependecies: 
can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

Example:
Run "python Traffic_PyCharm_V2.py" and select a camera by typing "***camera_1***" up to "***camera_6***". Hit "q" to exit.
